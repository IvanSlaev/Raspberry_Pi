CROSS COMPILATION for Raspbian kernel 4.9.y (thanks to www.grendelman.net)
on your host x64 machine terminal:

cd
 
mkdir ~/raspberrypi

cd ~/raspberrypi

git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux.git

git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools.git

cd linux

make -j n ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=~/raspberrypi/tools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian-x64/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf- bcm2709_defconfig

make -j n ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=~/raspberrypi/tools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian-x64/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-

Now you have a cross compiled linux kernel (in ~/raspberrypi/linux) and cross compilation tools (in ~/raspberrypi/tools).
To compile modules against it you just need to use Makefiles.onhost(do not forget to specify the module name in Makefile).

ONBOARD COMPILATION for Raspbian - see pandalion98's answer in:

http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/39845/how-compile-a-loadable-kernel-module-without-recompiling-kernel

After you upgrade your kernel version and install sources, use Makefile.(do not forget to specify the module name in Makefile).
